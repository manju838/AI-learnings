This repo documents my learnings and code related to AI. I will be segregating models based on their domain of downstream task (vision, text&nlp, multimodal and Others) while also adding a Building_blocks directory where unique concepts/ reusable components in the architecture are described.

Huggingface:

The section on huggingface uses direct models and implementations on Huggingface to develop rapid prototyping skills.

This section is based on Documentations page in huggingface.
