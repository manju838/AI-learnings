## Deep_Dive_into_Metrics

This section covers all the important metrics that I encountered, their explanations, formulae and the domains they appear.

Bounding boxes are boxes around the object used to detect them in object detection algorithms. They are defines using the (top left, bottom right coordinates) or center of bounding box coordinates along with width and height of box.

## 1. Intersection over Union(IoU):

IoU is a way to measure how well the computer programâ€™s drawn box matches the real object.
## 2. Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU):

## 3. Average Precision (AP):

## 4. Mean Average Precision (mAP):

## 5. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

## 6. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):

## 7. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):

## 8. Classification Accuracy:

The percentage of correctly classified images over the total number of images in the test dataset.


## 9. Precision:

## 10. Recall:

## 11. F1-Score:
